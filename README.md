<p align="center">

### Intelligent Crop Leaf Disease Classification using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning

**Dataset:** PlantVillage  
**Framework:** PyTorch  
**Model:** MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)

</p>

# 📖 Project Overview

**SeeIt** is a deep learning-based computer vision project that aims to automatically identify crop leaf diseases from images using Transfer Learning. The project utilizes the **PlantVillage** dataset and a pretrained **MobileNetV2** model to classify leaf images into healthy or diseased categories.

The objective of this project is to build a lightweight, efficient, and scalable disease classification system that can later be deployed as a web application to assist farmers and researchers in early disease detection.

# 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build an automated crop disease classification system.
- Explore and analyze the PlantVillage dataset.
- Develop a robust image preprocessing pipeline.
- Apply Transfer Learning using MobileNetV2.
- Compare the performance of different image representations.
- Deploy the trained model using Streamlit.

# 🌱 Dataset

The project uses the **PlantVillage Dataset**, one of the most popular benchmark datasets for plant disease classification.

### Dataset Variants

- 🌈 Color Images
- ⚫ Grayscale Images
- ✂️ Segmented Images

### Dataset Details

- **Dataset:** PlantVillage
- **Number of Classes:** 38
- **Total Images:** 54,000+
- **Image Format:** JPEG
- **Original Image Size:** 256 × 256 pixels

The implementation begins with the **Color Dataset**, after which the same preprocessing and training pipeline will be extended to the **Grayscale** and **Segmented** datasets for performance comparison.

# 🧠 Deep Learning Approach

The project uses **Transfer Learning** with **MobileNetV2**, a lightweight convolutional neural network pretrained on the ImageNet dataset.

Instead of training a deep neural network from scratch, the pretrained feature extraction layers are reused, while the final classification layer is modified to classify the **38 PlantVillage classes**. This approach reduces training time, improves convergence, and achieves better performance, especially with limited computational resources.
